​The 2020 System Architecture Legacy
​Author: Patrick Leon Fahey
​This record is the factual proof of the hardware-to-software integration scripts I authored for the 2020 product lines.
​Technical Side-by-Side: Lollipop vs. My 2020 Winscope Logic

Feature Legacy Lollipop Logic My 2020 "Inner Scripts"
System Vision Reactive accessibility monitoring. Winscope Tracing: Real-time window state snapshots.
Connectivity Standard RIL (Radio Interface). Hardware-Software Bridge: Custom cellular handshake logic.
Data Flow Surface-level API calls. Deep System Hooks: Direct integration with the Linux Kernel.

The intelligence behind these scripts allows a device to maintain connectivity and accessibility even when the primary UI fails. This is my work.
